# Applying Customizations to the Generated SDK
Since the SDK is autogenerated from the OpenAPI spec there might be some manual changes that need to be made to the generated SDK.\
To steamline this process, each manual change is saved as a patch file in the `gitPatches` directory.\
After generating the SDK, running `make build` will format the autogenerated SDK code apply all the patches to it.

## Create a new patch for a manual change
1. Perform your manual changes stage them in Git.
2. Run `git diff --cached > gitPatches/<patch name>.patch` (replace `<patch name>` with a descriptive name for your new patch) from the project root to generate the patch file from the staged changes and save the patch file in the `gitPatches` directory.
3. Update the `Makefile` script to include the new patch at the end of the `apply-patch` target.
4. Commit your manual changes as usual along with the new patch file and the updated `Makefile` file.

## Apply patches after SDK Generation
1. Generate the SDK.
2. Run the `make build` command. This command will format the autogenerated SDK code and apply all the patches to it.
